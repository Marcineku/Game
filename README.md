It is my first game project this big, meant to be an 2D top down action RPG and a end of term project assignment (although writing this project is really fun). It's fully written in Java using LibGDX with Box2D for physics and shadows. Player, bow and arrows animations are made by me, the rest are placeholders.
# Game controls

### F                    - to spawn a slime at current cursor location
