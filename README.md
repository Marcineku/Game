It is my first game project this big, meant to be a 2D top down action RPG and a end of term project assignment (although writing this project was really fun). It's fully written in Java using LibGDX with Box2D for physics and shadows. Player, bow and arrows animations are made by me, rest are placeholders.

### F                    - to spawn a slime at current cursor location
